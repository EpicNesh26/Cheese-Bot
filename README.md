### What did I learn?
Building Cheese Bot was an excellent learning experience that covered several key areas:
1. **Bot Development**: Learned how to create and manage a Discord bot using the Discord.py library.
2. **API Interaction**: Gained experience with handling API calls and managing asynchronous requests.
3. **User Interaction**: Developed skills in creating interactive and user-friendly commands.
4. **Environment Management**: Implemented best practices for managing environment variables and dependencies.
5. **Project Structuring**: Learned how to structure a Python project for clarity and maintainability
### How did I build it?
1. **Setup**: <br>
      Started by setting up a new Python project and creating a virtual environment. <br>
      Installed the required libraries, including Discord.py for bot development.
2. **Bot Creation**: <br>
      Registered a new bot on the Discord Developer Portal and obtained a token. <br>
      Used the Discord.py library to initialize the bot and set up basic event handling.
3. **Command Development**: <br>
      Created various commands such as ?cheesebot, ?joke, and ?fact.<br>
      Implemented logic for each command to provide jokes and facts from predefined lists.<br>
      Added a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to demonstrate more interactive features.
      Created a lot of commands for discord
4. **Testing and Deployment**: <br>
      Tested the bot locally to ensure all commands worked as expected.<br>
      Invited the bot to a private Discord server for further testing.
5. **Documentation**: <br>
      Created a comprehensive README file to document the project's purpose, features, and setup instructions.<br>
      The project file named main.py is actually a copy file which doesnt include the bot token and other api keys so as to keep the sensitive info of myself private.
